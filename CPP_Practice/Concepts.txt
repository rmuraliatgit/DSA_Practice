* Always use '\n' rather using 'endl', because for each statement till escape character endl prints the output on the console screen then it moves to next line of output.
* When the input is in size of 10^6 or 10^7 it is good to have fast io. i.e.,
ios_base::sync_with_stdio(0); cin.tie(0); cout.tie(0); This will make it faster.
* To make all the int to long long we can #define int long long and 
* Array will goes to a function by reference only, so where every you change a value of an array it gets reflected everywhere
* Use the dot operator (.) when you have a reference or an object.
* Use the arrow operator (->) when you have a pointer or an iterator (which behaves like a pointer).
